# Prompts
I used Cursor with gpt-4o to create the tests.

## Prompt 1

We want to prepare the backend project in order to be able to execute unit tests from the console using the command npm test. We would like to use ts-jest for that. Give me the necessary changes in order to prepare the project for the task.

## Answer

To set up unit testing with ts-jest in your backend project, you need to make several changes. Here are the necessary steps:
Install the required dependencies:
Run the following command to install jest, ts-jest, and @types/jest:
jest
Create a Jest configuration file:
Create a file named jest.config.js in the root of your backend directory with the following content:
;
Update tsconfig.json to include test files:
Modify the tsconfig.json file to include test files. Update the include section as follows:
]
,
Add a test script to package.json:
Add the test script to the scripts section in your package.json:
,
,
Create a sample test file:
Create a directory named tests in the root of your backend directory. Inside this directory, create a file named sample.test.ts with the following content:
;
Run the tests:
Execute the following command to run your tests:
test
These steps will set up ts-jest for your backend project and allow you to run unit tests using the npm test command.

## Prompt 2

I followed the tests and received this error:

raul@RG701701 backend % npm test

## Answer

The error message indicates that the validateName function did not throw an error as expected. To debug this, you should check the implementation of the validateName function to ensure it throws an error for invalid names.
Here is a possible implementation of the validateName function:
validator.ts
}
Make sure your validateName function is correctly implemented to throw an error for invalid names. If the function is already implemented correctly, you might want to add some logging or debugging to see why it is not throwing an error as expected.
If the function is correct, ensure that the test cases are also correct. Here is the test file for reference:
;
If everything seems correct and the issue persists, you might want to add some console logs inside the validateName function to see what is happening during the test execution.

## Prompt 3

Now we want to achieve 100% unit test coverage for all the .ts files of the backend project. But let's start with one single file. Let's proceed with the file @candidateRoutes.ts . Add all the necessary unit tests to the file @tests-rgm.test.ts . Consider all the corner cases.

## Answer

To achieve 100% unit test coverage for the candidateRoutes.ts file, we need to test the route handler for the POST request. This involves testing both successful and error scenarios.
Here is the updated tests-rgm.test.ts file with the necessary unit tests for candidateRoutes.ts:
tests-rgm.test.ts
;
This test suite covers the following scenarios for the candidateRoutes.ts file:
Successful candidate addition: Ensures that a candidate is added successfully and a 201 status is returned.
Validation error: Ensures that a 400 status is returned if the addCandidate function throws an error.
Unexpected error: Ensures that a 500 status is returned for unexpected errors.

## Prompt 4

Ok, now let's create the unit tests for the file @Education.ts, they should also be added to the file @tests-rgm.test.ts 

## Answer

Sure, here are the unit tests for the Education class added to the tests-rgm.test.ts file:
tests-rgm.test.ts
;
This code adds unit tests for the Education class to the tests-rgm.test.ts file. The tests cover creating a new education record and updating an existing one.

## Prompt 5

When running npm test -- --detectOpenHandles I get the following
Jest has detected the following 2 open handles potentially keeping Jest from exiting:

## Answer

The issue is that the server is still running and keeping the process open. To resolve this, you need to close the server after the tests are done.
Step 1: Modify the index.ts to export the server instance
Update your index.ts to export the server instance:
;
;
Step 2: Import and close the server in your test file
Update your test file to import the server and close it after all tests are done:
;
;
Add the afterAll block to close the server:
;
;
Updated Test File
Here is the updated test file with the changes:
tests-rgm.test.ts
;
This should resolve the issue of open handles and allow Jest to exit cleanly after the tests

## Prompt 6

Ok, now let's create the unit tests for the file Candidate.ts , they should also be added to the file tests-rgm.test.ts 

## Answer

Sure, let's add unit tests for the Candidate class to the tests-rgm.test.ts file. We'll test the save and findOne methods.
Here's the updated tests-rgm.test.ts file with the new tests:
tests-rgm.test.ts
;
This adds unit tests for the Candidate class, specifically testing the save and findOne methods. The tests cover creating a new candidate, updating an existing candidate, finding a candidate by ID, and handling the case where a candidate is not found
